# Finite-Automata-Simulator

DFA and NFA to DFA converter:

Theory of machines and languages course project. 
`dfa.py` reads a DFA from `DFA.txt` in the following input order and then gets a string from input. Then it outputs whether input string was accepted by DFA or not. 
`nfa_to_dfa.py` reads a NFA from `NFA.txt` in the following input order and then writes equivalent DFA to `DFA.txt`.

Input file format:


* First line are automata's alphabet separated by space. 
* Second line are states in the automata separated by space. 
* Third line is initial state of automata. 
* Fourth line are final states separated by space. 
* And the rest are transitions in states in the automata and each line specifies one transition in the automata (that has the following order): 

<current state> <letter> <next state>
